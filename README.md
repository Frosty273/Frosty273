### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where you can have a look at the projects I've been working on.

I am an Graduate from the University of Auckland, Majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems. I am currently pursuing my Honours degree in Computer Science at the University of Auckland

I love problem solving and programming, which is what lead to my interest in the development field of work. I am also good at coming up with creative solutions and work well in a team.
